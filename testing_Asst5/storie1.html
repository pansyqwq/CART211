                    <h2>Ms. America pageant</h2>
                    <p>“I was seventeen. Only child, not a lot of friends. But I had a plan. I was going to become an
                        actress, get a role on
                        All My Children, meet my husband on set– and when that was all over, I’d host a talk show. Kelly
                        Ripa did it; I could do
                        it too. Back then it seemed like every woman on television had gotten their start as beauty
                        queen. So my senior year I
                        decided to enter my school’s Homecoming Queen competition. It was organized like a Ms. America
                        pageant. But this was a rough high school, only one other girl signed up, so I had a good shot.
                        My whole family got
                        behind me. My mom was a seamstress. We noticed that in most pageants we watched, the winner wore
                        a white dress. So she
                        sewed me a white dress that I picked out of Seventeen Magazine. First came the interview
                        portion, and that’s when the trouble started. The judges asked me about the Anita Hill
                        testimony; I wasn’t ready for that. I
                        was ready for world
                        peace. </p>
                    <p>They were supposed to ask me about my goals, so I could say world peace. But that didn’t happen.
                        The talent portion was later that night at
                        the homecoming dance. The whole school was there. I chose a Sheena Easton song; poor choice. Not
                        the right crowd for
                        that. The other girl chose ‘I Feel Good’ by Stephanie Mills, and she had the whole crowd singing
                        along. That’s when I
                        knew it was over. But then, a miracle. The guidance counselor quieted everyone down, and
                        announced the winner: it was
                        me. Me! It was my Kelly Kapowski moment. Everyone was cheering, the other girl congratulated me.
                        But it only lasted five
                        seconds, because the guidance counselor said: ‘Wait a second, I’m sorry. Joanna is the
                        runner-up.’ It was the worst
                        moment of my life. In fact, the only thing that got me through COVID was knowing that it could
                        not possibly, possibly be
                        worse than that moment. And here’s a twist for you. Remember that guidance counselor? Several
                        years later I ended up
                        acting alongside his son in a play at Queens College. In one scene I pulled a gun on him, and
                        the director was like: ‘We
                        need more anger. Think about something that makes you angry.’ I was like: ‘Well, that’s easy.
                        His father ruined my
                        senior year. And quite possibly, my entire life.”
