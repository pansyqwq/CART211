            <p>Humans of New York began as Brandon Stanton photography project in 2010. The initial goal was to
                photograph 10,000 New Yorkers on the street, and create an exhaustive catalogue of the city’s
                inhabitants.
            </p>
            <p>Taken together, these portraits and captions became the subject of a vibrant blog. HONY now has over
                twenty million followers on social media, and provides a worldwide audience with daily glimpses into the
                lives of strangers on the streets of New York City.

                            <h2>Ms. America pageant</h2>
                            <p>“I was seventeen. Only child, not a lot of friends. But I had a plan. I was going to
                                become an
                                actress, get a role on
                                All My Children, meet my husband on set– and when that was all over, I’d host a talk
                                show. Kelly
                                Ripa did it; I could do
                                it too. Back then it seemed like every woman on television had gotten their start as
                                beauty
                                queen. So my senior year I
                                decided to enter my school’s Homecoming Queen competition. It was organized like a Ms.
                                America
                                pageant. But this was a rough high school, only one other girl signed up, so I had a
                                good shot.
                                My whole family got
                                behind me. My mom was a seamstress. We noticed that in most pageants we watched, the
                                winner wore
                                a white dress. So she
                                sewed me a white dress that I picked out of Seventeen Magazine. First came the interview
                                portion, and that’s when the trouble started. The judges asked me about the Anita Hill
                                testimony; I wasn’t ready for that. I
                                was ready for world
                                peace. </p>
                            <p>They were supposed to ask me about my goals, so I could say world peace. But that didn’t
                                happen.
                                The talent portion was later that night at
                                the homecoming dance. The whole school was there. I chose a Sheena Easton song; poor
                                choice. Not
                                the right crowd for
                                that. The other girl chose ‘I Feel Good’ by Stephanie Mills, and she had the whole crowd
                                singing
                                along. That’s when I
                                knew it was over. But then, a miracle. The guidance counselor quieted everyone down, and
                                announced the winner: it was
                                me. Me! It was my Kelly Kapowski moment. Everyone was cheering, the other girl
                                congratulated me.
                                But it only lasted five
                                seconds, because the guidance counselor said: ‘Wait a second, I’m sorry. Joanna is the
                                runner-up.’ It was the worst
                                moment of my life. In fact, the only thing that got me through COVID was knowing that it
                                could
                                not possibly, possibly be
                                worse than that moment. And here’s a twist for you. Remember that guidance counselor?
                                Several
                                years later I ended up
                                acting alongside his son in a play at Queens College. In one scene I pulled a gun on
                                him, and
                                the director was like: ‘We
                                need more anger. Think about something that makes you angry.’ I was like: ‘Well, that’s
                                easy.
                                His father ruined my
                                senior year. And quite possibly, my entire life.”
